Copyright (c) 2025 MemerGamer

A permissive open-source license that encourages responsible AI usage
while preventing mindless commercial exploitation through "vibecoding."

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
=================================================================

SECTION 1: GRANT OF LICENSE

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or entity
obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files
(the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction for
NON-COMMERCIAL purposes, including without limitation the rights to
use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software.

SECTION 2: COMMERCIAL USE REQUIREMENTS

Any COMMERCIAL use, distribution, or derivation of the Software must
comply with ALL of the following requirements:

2.1 HUMAN VERIFICATION MANDATE
    All code in the Software or derivative works, regardless of
    authorship method, must be reviewed, understood, and verified
    for correctness by qualified human developers before commercial
    distribution.

2.2 AI USAGE DISCLOSURE & ATTRIBUTION

    2.2.1 THRESHOLD: 50% AI-Generated Content
          If AI systems generated ≥50% but <70% of NEW code in a
          derivative work (measured by significant lines of code or
          functional contribution), you MUST:
          
          a) Include prominent attribution to the original project:
             - In product documentation
             - In user-facing "About" or "Credits" sections
             - In README or similar distribution files
             
          b) Include an AI_USAGE.md file documenting:
             - Percentage of AI-generated code
             - Development methodology
             - Human verification process
             - Link to original project

    2.2.2 HARD CAP: 70% AI-Generated Content
          If AI systems generated ≥70% of NEW code in a derivative
          work, commercial distribution is PROHIBITED. The commercial
          license is automatically VOID.
          
          Exception: You may request explicit written permission from
          the original copyright holder(s).

2.3 DEFINITIONS

    "AI-generated code" means source code where an artificial
    intelligence system produced the implementation from natural
    language prompts or instructions, without substantial human
    redesign of the generated output.
    
    INCLUDES (counts toward AI percentage):
    ✗ Using AI to generate feature implementations with <40% human modification
    ✗ "Vibecoding" - prompting features without understanding internals
    ✗ AI-written critical business logic without human design input
    ✗ AI-designed architecture without human verification
    ✗ Direct prompt-to-production workflows
    
    EXCLUDES (does NOT count toward AI percentage):
    ✓ Boilerplate code (imports, configurations, basic CRUD patterns)
    ✓ Code completion and autocomplete suggestions
    ✓ Automated refactoring and code formatting
    ✓ AI suggestions modified substantially by humans (≥40% changes)
    ✓ AI-designed architecture that humans verified and approved
    ✓ Documentation, comments, and docstrings
    ✓ Test scaffolding and mock data
    ✓ Debugging assistance and error fixes
    
    "NEW code" means code added or substantially modified in the
    derivative work, excluding the original Software's codebase.
    
    "COMMERCIAL use" means any use where the primary purpose is
    commercial advantage or monetary compensation, including:
    - Direct sale of software
    - SaaS or subscription services
    - Ad-supported distribution
    - Freemium models with paid features
    - Internal use in commercial operations (enterprise use)

2.4 CRITICAL LOGIC REQUIREMENTS
    Core business logic, security implementations, authentication
    systems, and data handling code must have demonstrable human
    design input, even if AI assists with implementation details.

2.5 COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION
    Commercial distributors must maintain reasonable development
    records demonstrating compliance and provide good-faith
    attestation upon written request from the copyright holder(s).

SECTION 3: ENFORCEMENT

3.1 BREACH OF LICENSE
    Failure to comply with Section 2 requirements constitutes a
    material breach of this license and automatically terminates
    your rights under this license.

3.2 CURE PERIOD
    Upon written notice of non-compliance, you have 30 days to:
    - Provide required attribution and documentation, OR
    - Cease commercial distribution
    
    Failure to cure results in permanent license termination.

3.3 GOOD FAITH STANDARD
    This license assumes good faith compliance. Deliberate
    misrepresentation of AI usage or obvious violations
    (e.g., trivial rebranding of AI-generated derivatives)
    constitute willful breach.

SECTION 4: COMPATIBILITY

This license is designed to be compatible with:
- GNU GPL v3.0 (derivative can be relicensed as GPL v3)
- Apache License 2.0 patent grants
- MIT License for non-commercial portions

When combining with other licenses, the most restrictive commercial
terms apply.

SECTION 5: GENERAL PROVISIONS

5.1 The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
    included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

5.2 Redistributions must retain this license file and any
    AI_USAGE.md documentation.

5.3 This license applies to the Software and all derivative works.

5.4 License versioning follows semantic versioning. "NSL-1.0" refers
    specifically to this version. Future versions may have different
    terms.
