# AI Usage Documentation

**Note:** This disclosure is voluntary. NSL applies to software code, not
documentation or license text. We're including this to demonstrate
transparency and show what NSL compliance looks like in practice.

**Self-disclosure for the No-Slop License project**

## Project Information

- Project Name: No-Slop License (NSL)
- Original Project: N/A (original work)
- License: CC0 (Public Domain) - the license text itself is freely usable
- Date: 2025-10-30

## AI Usage Metrics

### New Content Statistics

- Total content: ~2,500 words across license text, README, and templates
- AI-generated: ~70% (initial drafts and structure)
- Human-authored: ~30% (concept, requirements, refinement)

### Breakdown by Component

| Component            | Approx. Words | AI % | Human % | Notes                           |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ---- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| LICENSE-NSL-1.0.txt  | ~1,500        | 80%  | 20%     | AI drafted, human-refined terms |
| README.md            | ~800          | 50%  | 50%     | AI structured, human-directed   |
| TEMPLATE-AI_USAGE.md | ~200          | 80%  | 20%     | AI generated template structure |
| Core concept         | N/A           | 0%   | 100%    | Entirely human-originated       |

## Development Methodology

### AI Tools Used

- Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Reasoning) via T3 Chat
- Usage scope: Text generation, legal structure, documentation, examples

### Human Direction Process

- **Concept creation**: 100% human (@MemerGamer)

  - Identified the vibecoding problem
  - Defined 50%/70% thresholds
  - Specified attribution requirements
  - Named the license "No-Slop"

- **Iterative refinement**: Human-led collaboration

  - Human rejected initial "tool restriction" approach
  - Human refined commercial vs non-commercial terms
  - Human decided on specific thresholds and requirements
  - Human approved final language

- **Review**: All text reviewed and understood by creator

### Critical Components

The following were entirely human-designed:

- **Core philosophy**: Preventing vibecoding while allowing smart AI usage
- **Threshold system**: 50% disclosure requirement, 70% hard cap
- **Attribution mechanism**: Link back + AI_USAGE.md requirement
- **License name and branding**: "No-Slop License"

## Development Process

1. **Human**: Identified problem with AI code exploitation
2. **AI**: Suggested various restrictive approaches
3. **Human**: Refined to focus on commercial use only
4. **AI**: Drafted legal language based on requirements
5. **Human**: Reviewed, requested changes to thresholds and definitions
6. **AI**: Revised license text, README, templates
7. **Human**: Approved and published

## Compliance Statement

This project demonstrates NSL principles in practice:

- All AI-generated content was reviewed and understood
- Human drove the creative direction and requirements
- Core concepts and philosophy are human-originated
- AI was used as a tool for structure and legal language
- Transparent about AI usage (this document)

**Note:** This is documentation, not software code. If this were commercial software with 75% AI-generated code, it would exceed NSL's 70% threshold and require explicit permission or primarily human authorship.

## Irony Acknowledgment

Yes, we used significant AI assistance to create a license about AI usage:)

The difference is:

- The **concept** is entirely human
- The **requirements** are human-defined
- The **philosophy** is human-driven
- AI provided structure, legal language, and documentation

This is the kind of smart AI collaboration NSL encourages - not mindless vibecoding.

_This transparency is what we hope to see from all NSL-compliant projects._
